# Binary-Classification-with-a-Kidney-Stone-Prediction-Dataset
A deep learning model trained on the Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis dataset. 

# Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis
This project uses deep learning techniques to predict the presence of kidney stones in urine samples based on urine analysis data. The dataset used in this project is the Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis dataset.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

# R version 4.0 or higher
-RStudio version 1.4 or higher
-Required R packages, including keras, tensorflow, caret, and readr
 Dataset
-The Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis dataset contains urine analysis data for 400 patients, including their age, gender, and various urine measurements. -The target variable is the presence or absence of kidney stones in the urine.

# The dataset is included in the project as a CSV file named kidney_stones.csv.

# Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

-Clone the project repository to your local machine.
-Open the RStudio project file (kidney_stone_prediction.Rproj) in RStudio.
-Install the required R packages if you haven't already done so using install.packages().
-Load the kidney_stones.csv dataset into RStudio using read_csv().
-Preprocess the dataset using functions like train_test_split() and normalize().
-Define the architecture of the deep learning model using keras functions like layers, activation functions, and optimizers.
-Train the deep learning model on the training data using fit().
-Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation and testing datasets using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
-Use the deep learning model to predict the presence of kidney stones in new urine samples.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use deep learning techniques in RStudio to predict the presence of kidney stones in urine samples based on urine analysis data. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can replicate this project on your own machine and adapt it to your own datasets and research questions
